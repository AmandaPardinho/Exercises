## :straight_ruler:**Exercise_One**

> In this exercise, the goal was to create an array, of size n, containing the height of these n individuals. So, the array I created had n = 6 and the heights were determined randomly.
>
> Next, a variable sum was also created which, after its initialization, should contain the total sum of the values of the heights. To perform the sum, a 'for' was used so that the entire array was traversed and at each new position in the array, the new height was added to the sum.
>
> At the end, with the result of the total sum of the heights, it was possible to calculate the average height of the individuals on this list.
