## **Exercise_One**

> In this exercise, the goal was to create an array, of size n, containing the height of these n individuals. So, the array I created had n = 6 and the heights were determined randomly.
>
> Next, a variable sum was also created which, after its initialization, should contain the total sum of the values of the heights.
